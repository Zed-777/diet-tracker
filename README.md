## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Supabase project with `diet_data` table
- Cloudflare account with Pages + Workers
- GitHub repository

### 1. Create Supabase Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE diet_data (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE diet_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "allow all" ON diet_data
  FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 2. Configure Cloudflare Environment Variables

In your Cloudflare Pages project → Settings → Environment variables, add:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=[your-anon-public-key]
```

**Where to find these:**
- Go to your Supabase project → Settings → API Keys
- Copy the Project URL and anon public key
- Paste into Cloudflare environment variables

### 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

```bash
npm install -D wrangler
wrangler publish
```

Or connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages for automatic deployment on every push.

### 4. Verify Setup

Once deployed, visit your Cloudflare Pages deployment URL. The app should:

- Load the Diet Tracker UI
- Allow profile creation
- Save meals to your Supabase database
- Work offline with sync support

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend

- **Single-file SPA** — All UI, logic, and styles in `diet-tracker.html`
- **No build step** — Works directly in browser
- **Responsive design** — Mobile-first, works on all devices
- **9 modules:**
  - `DB` — Supabase REST wrapper
  - `CALC` — BMR, TDEE, macros, BMI calculations
  - `MEALS` — 42 recipes library
  - `VALID` — Input validation with range checks
  - `OFFLINE` — Offline detection and operation queueing
  - `LANG` — EN/ES translations
  - Plus 8 screens: Today, Meals, Progress, Analytics, Weight, Notes, Settings, Community

### Backend

- **Supabase PostgreSQL** — Data persistence
- **Table:** `diet_data` with JSONB blob storage
- **Data structure:**

```javascript
  {
    profile: { name, age, height, weight, goal, experience },
    weights: [ { date, value } ],
    log_YYYY-MM-DD: { meals: [], water: 0, notes: '' },
    meal_swaps: { date: { index: swapId } },
    preferences: { language, theme, units }
  }
```

### Deployment

- **Cloudflare Pages** — Static hosting + auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Cloudflare Workers** — Credential injection via `functions/api/env.js`
- **Environment variables** stored in Cloudflare (zero hardcoded secrets)

---

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ **Zero hardcoded secrets** — Credentials injected at runtime
- ✅ **Environment variables** stored in Cloudflare only
- ✅ **Input validation** on all numeric fields
- ✅ **Error boundaries** prevent crashes, show user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Offline operation queueing** prevents data loss
- ✅ **Memory cleanup** on navigation prevents leaks
- ✅ **No sensitive data in localStorage** — Only temporary UI state

- Verify Supabase credentials in Cloudflare env vars
- Clear browser cache and reload

**Data not saving:**

- Check browser console network tab
- Verify Supabase table exists
- Check RLS policies allow INSERT/UPDATE

**Built with ❤️ — Stable & Maintained**

### Persistence

- Auto-saves on every action (meals, water, weight, grocery)
- Loads all data on app startup
- localStorage for theme preference only

---

## Customization

### Change Default Theme

Edit the `init()` function:

```javascript
applyTheme(localStorage.getItem('dt-theme') || 'pink');  // or 'dark', 'light'
```

### Meal Library

The app includes **42 diverse recipes** designed for real variety:

- **10 Breakfasts**: eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, pancakes, bagels, burritos, etc.
- **11 Lunches**: chicken, fish, beef, vegetarian, soups, salads, stir-fries, pasta
- **10 Dinners**: salmon, chicken, turkey, pork, cod, curries, seafood, roasted vegetables
- **11 Snacks**: protein shakes, fruits, nuts, cheese, yogurt, jerky, hummus, energy balls

Each meal is:

- **Goal-tagged**: meals specify which goals they suit (`['lose','build','definition','maintenance']`)
- **Nutritionally balanced**: accurate macros and calories
- **Practical**: realistic prep times (2–30 minutes)
- **Diverse**: different cuisines, proteins, cooking methods

This provides ~8–9 weeks of rotation before any date repeats the same meals.

### Modify Meal Database

Edit the `MEALS` object in `diet-tracker.html` to add/remove meals. Each meal needs:

- `id`, `name`, `cal`, `protein`, `carbs`, `fat`, `prepTime`
- `goals` — array of applicable goals: `['lose','build','definition','maintenance']`
- `ingredients` — list with `item`, `amount`, `unit`, `cat` (category)
- `recipe` — array of step strings

### Adjust Macro Splits

Edit the `CALC.macros()` function to change protein/carb/fat ratios per goal.

## Troubleshooting

### "Page not found" on Netlify

- Ensure `netlify.toml` contains the SPA redirect rule
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### "No repositories found" in Netlify

- Reconnect GitHub auth in Netlify: User → Applications → GitHub → Reconnect
- Make sure the repo is public or Netlify has access

### Supabase connection errors

- Check internet connection
- Verify `SB_URL` and `SB_KEY` are correct
- Confirm `diet_data` table exists and RLS policy allows access
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Theme changes don't persist

- Clear browser localStorage for the app domain
- Or check browser privacy/tracking settings

---

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important for production:**

1. **Don't expose credentials**
   - This project now reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` from `window.__ENV`
   - Keep `config.js` private and out of git
   - Implement [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for user-specific data
   - Use JWT tokens and user-scoped RLS policies

2. **Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)**

   ```sql
   create policy "Users can only read/write their own data" on diet_data
     for all using (auth.uid() = user_id) with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. **Restrict Anon Role**
   - Limit to read-only or disable entirely
   - Use authenticated users only

4. **Environment variables**
   - Store Supabase credentials in Netlify/Cloudflare environment variables
   - Inject `window.__ENV` at deploy time

5. **Data privacy**
   - This app stores personal health data (weight, goals, macros)
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
   - Never share repos with embedded credentials

---

## Development

### Local testing

Simply open `diet-tracker.html` in a browser. No server required.

### Separating files (future)

To improve maintainability:

- Move CSS to `styles.css`
- Move JS to `app.js`
- Update `diet-tracker.html` to import them

### Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Areas for improvement:

- Better error handling and user feedback
- Offline-first with service workers
- Export meal plan as PDF
- Integration with fitness trackers
